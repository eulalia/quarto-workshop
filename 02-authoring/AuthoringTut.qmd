## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Rendering

pdf rendering from the Terminal fails though it succeeds when running if from the Console with 

```{r renderpdf}
#| echo: false
#is this making some kind of a recursive call
quarto_render("AuthoringTut.qmd", output_format = "pdf")
```
```{r fenced code}
#| echo: fenced
1 + 1
```
````
```{{r not executed}}
1+1
```
````
